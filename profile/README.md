**For those in a hurry:** [tracetronic](https://www.tracetronic.com) develops solutions for the **automated testing and integration of automotive software.**

**More precisely:** we combat increasingly complex functions and exponentially rising data volumes in vehicles with **test automation** and a framework that allows the integration of even **heterogeneous test landscapes, including third-party tools**. Thatâ€™s number one.

**Number two:** we have always worked â€“ and always will â€“ according to the **principles of agile software development**. This means we are really quick in adapting to changing project conditions and we always put the **customer benefit first**.

Still too short? See the official [tracetronic Website](https://www.tracetronic.com).

<h2 align="center">Automotive DevOps Platform</h2>

With the [Automotive DevOps Platform](https://www.tracetronic.com/solutions/automotive-devops-platform), we go from the big picture to the details and unite **all phases of vehicle software testing** â€“ from planning the test scopes to summarizing the test results. At the same time, **continuous monitoring across all test phases** always provides an overview of all activities â€“ even with several thousand test executions per day and in different test environments.

Our platform follows the _batteries-included_ approach. Therefore, a lot of different open-source
batteries, are located in our GitHub repositories with extensions, adapters, examples and
templates
around our platform and also around our software products [ecu.test](https://www.tracetronic.com/products/ecu-test/), [trace.check](https://www.tracetronic.com/products/trace-check/) and [test.guide](https://www.tracetronic.com/products/test-guide/).

<h2 align="center">Overview</h2>

### Batteries for the Automotive DevOps Platform
The tracetronic GitHub organization contains currently the following batteries

* [ecu-test_custom-checks](https://github.com/tracetronic/ecu-test_custom-checks)
* [cx-templates](https://github.com/tracetronic/cx-templates)
* [helm-charts](https://github.com/tracetronic/helm-charts)
* [jenkins-library](https://github.com/tracetronic/jenkins-library)

Please visit these repositories to get a short introduction containing the use cases and some instructions to start using them.

### Jenkins Plugin
Our approach for testing is based on an easy integration of ecu.test into your continuous integration workflows. Because a lot of our customers are still using [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io) as CI platform of choice our Plugin bridges the gap and allows the test process to be flexibly adapted to the specific requirements of the project.

Our [ecu.test Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ecutest-plugin) and [ecu.test Execution Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ecu-test-execution-plugin) are hosted by the Jenkins community like any other Jenkins Plugins. The repositories in this organization are only the origins.
